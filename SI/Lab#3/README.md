## DiffieHellman

Construct the DiffieHellman key exchange algorithm.

## Definition

DiffieHellman key exchange (DH)is a specific method of exchanging cryptographic keys. It is one of the earliest
practical examples of key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography. The DiffieHellman key exchange
method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over
an insecure communications channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a
symmetric key cipher.

## Conclusion

After making this laboratory work I learn about DiffieHellman method of exchanging cryptographic keys. The
protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if G and g are chosen properly, the order of G should have a large
prime factor to prevent use of the PohligHellman algorithm. Also if parties use random number generators whose
outputs are not completely random there is a possibility to predict to some extent.
