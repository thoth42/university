## 99 Bottles of Beer

First laboratory work present the test for composing the song 99 Bottles of Beer as an output.

### Purpose

The purpose of this laboratory work is to teach us how important is to write tests that only cover what
is necessary at the current state of application and not to plan ahead the architecture that you don't need.
You incrementally develop software adapting your code to the new requirements that appear during the lifetime of
application.
